This is a note that guides beginners to use Github to manage and track their projects.
Step 1: mkdir myfolder #to create a folder locally in laptop
Step 2: cd myfolder-> git init #to initialize Github
Step 3: touch myGitnote.txt #to create a new file in the current folder
Step 4: use a text editor, Atom or VIN editor... for instance to edit texts.
Step 5: git config --global user.name 'my name' and git config --global user.email 'myemail@gmail.com' to set up user information
Step 6: git add filename #to add files into repository
        Note: 'git add *.txt' to add all txt files
              'git add .' to add all files in the folder
              'git status' to view status, i.e., which file is added to staging and which is not tracked
              'git rm --cached *.txt' will remove the files from staging area
        If there are some files you want to ignore, create the file .gitignore by 'touch .gitignore' in command line
        Include files that we want to ignore in .gitignore.
        git add . will not add files in .gitignore
Step 7: git commit -m 'some message here for update' to commit changes
