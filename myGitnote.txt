# This is a note that guides beginners to use Github to manage and track their projects.
Step 1: mkdir myfolder #to create a folder locally in laptop
Step 2: cd myfolder-> git init #to initialize Github
Step 3: touch myGitnote.txt #to create a new file in the current folder
Step 4: use a text editor, Atom or VIN editor... for instance to edit texts.
Step 5: git config --global user.name 'my name' and git config --global user.email 'myemail@gmail.com' to set up user information
Step 6: git add filename #to add files into repository
        Note: 'git add *.txt' to add all txt files
              'git add .' to add all files in the folder
              'git status' to view status, i.e., which file is added to staging and which is not tracked
              'git rm --cached *.txt' will remove the files from staging area
        If there are some files you want to ignore, create the file .gitignore by 'touch .DS_Store' in command line
        Include files that we want to ignore in .gitignore. Just list files there, for instance .DS_Store(will be ingored), /dirtest/*(folder and its contents will be ignored)
        git add . will not add .DS_Store included in .gitignore
Step 7: git commit -m 'some message here for update' #to commit changes

Step 8: git push #to push changes to remote repository

# Regarding branches
For example, you want to add some sections to an existing project. You want to add it after you've completed that part separately. You can use branch and merge.
Create a branch called 'to_add' and work in that branch.

git branch to_add #to create the branch
git checkout to_add #to switch from master branch to this branch. You can use touch to_add.txt and edit there the contents. Note that this file is in the same myfolder.
git add .
git commit -m 'changes' #to commit changes before switching branches
git checkout master #to switch back to master branch. Here the files in to_add branch is gone because it's in another branch.
git merge to_add #to merge branches. now the to_add.txt file is added into the master branch.

# Remote repository
Create a new repository in your github account.
git remote add origin https://github.com/**repositoryname.git #in commend line in your working directory.
git push -u origin master # to push to remote repository.
